h1. Justification

This project was borne out of a need to upload files into Radiant CMS. I started by looking for existing upload extensions and the most popular one I found was Paperclipped. After experimenting with Paperclipped, I found that it was trying to be too smart for my needs. My clients need a basic upload feature that is simple. It should have the basic create, read, upload, and delete methods. It should be global and located in one place that is usable without training. This extension is a step in that direction.

h1. Features

* Upload binary files (images, pdf, etc.)
* View a list of uploaded files
* Delete files you have uploaded

h1. Feature Road Map

* Meta data: Tags, Keywords (which is optional)
* Subdirectories
* Search / Filter
